# **jTunes** (John's Tunes)



jTunes is a simple to use audio player, the end goal will be seamless syncing with original iPods with your current mp3 and mp4 media.


It uses libgpod for the heavy lifting of communicating with the iPod, you will need the repository that has been modified for python3 [GitHub - john8675309/libgpod-0.8.3: libgpod with python3 binding support](https://github.com/john8675309/libgpod-0.8.3)



jTunes is a work in progress as it's my first foray into Python3 and GTK
